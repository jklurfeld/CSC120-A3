We attended the Monday (9/26) TA hours

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 


- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
A conclusion about programming is general is it's very useful to consult the java doc while working through programs. Using the tools in the java development kit helped make it clear why using classes was useful in programming instead of putting everything in one file.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The split string method helped immensely in figuring out how to change the mirror words. Advice for someone taking this course in the future would be to be aware of case sensitivity when giving user input, to use print statements to debug your code, and to use your existing variables.
